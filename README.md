The easiest way to compile this is to use [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com).
You can alternatively download Tex Live on your computer and compile it offline. 

## Compiling using Overleaf 
- Download this repository as a zip file, click the green 'Clone or download' button and download as zip
- Sign up for an [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com) account 
- On Overleaf, click the green 'New Project' button and select 'Upload Project'
- Upload the zip file you just downloaded
- Overleaf should **automagically** compile it
